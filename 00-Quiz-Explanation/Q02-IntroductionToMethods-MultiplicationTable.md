In Java, `void` is a keyword used in method signatures. It indicates that the method does not return any value.

When you define a method in Java, you typically specify the type of value the method will return. For example, if a method returns an integer, you would write `int` before the method's name. However, some methods don't need to return a value; they just perform an action. For these methods, you would use the `void` keyword to indicate that no value is returned.

So, for option B) "The method does not return any value", this is the correct usage of the `void` keyword in Java. It's not associated with returning an integer (option A) or a boolean (option C), or any other type of value. That's why B) is the correct answer.

The correct answer is C) `sayHelloWorldTwice();`.

Here's why:

When calling a method in Java, you need to use the method name followed by parentheses. If the method accepts any arguments, they would go inside the parentheses. If it doesn't, the parentheses would be empty. So, `sayHelloWorldTwice()` is the correct syntax to call the method.

However, in Java, you typically follow a statement with a semicolon (`;`). This is a kind of "period" that signifies the end of a complete instruction. So to properly call the method in a Java program, you would write `sayHelloWorldTwice();`.

So, option A) `sayHelloWorldTwice` is incorrect because it is missing the parentheses and the semicolon. Option B) `sayHelloWorldTwice()` is partially correct because it includes the parentheses, but it is missing the semicolon. Option C) `sayHelloWorldTwice();` is the correct way to call a method in a Java program because it includes both the parentheses and the semicolon.

# 3

The correct answer is C) Defining and invoking methods are two different steps.

Here's why:

A) Defining a method automatically executes its statement body: This statement is incorrect. When you define a method in your Java code, it doesn't automatically get executed. It's only when you call or invoke this method in your code that the statements inside the method body get executed.

B) Defining a method and invoking it are the same thing: This statement is also incorrect. Defining a method means you are writing down the method's code, specifying its name, return type, parameters, and the statements it will execute. Invoking or calling a method means you are telling your program to execute the statements inside a method that has already been defined. So, these are two distinct steps in the process of using methods in Java.

C) Defining and invoking methods are two different steps: This statement is correct. As explained above, defining a method involves writing out the method's code and properties, while invoking a method involves executing the statements in the method. These are two separate actions that you perform at different times in your code. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

# 4

The correct answer is A) `void printHelloWorld() { System.out.println("Hello World"); }`.

Here's why:

A) `void printHelloWorld() { System.out.println("Hello World"); }`: This is the correct syntax for defining a method in Java. The `void` keyword indicates that the method doesn't return any value. `printHelloWorld()` is the method name with no parameters, followed by the method body enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Inside the method body, `System.out.println("Hello World");` is a statement that prints the string "Hello World" to the console.

B) `printHelloWorld() { System.out.println("Hello World"); }`: This syntax is incorrect because it's missing the return type of the method. In Java, you must specify the return type before the method name. In this case, it should be `void` since the method doesn't return any value.

C) `void printHelloWorld { System.out.println("Hello World"); }`: This syntax is incorrect because it's missing the parentheses `()` after the method name. In Java, you must use parentheses after the method name, even if the method doesn't take any parameters. So, it should be `printHelloWorld()`.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

# 5

  
The correct answer is B) `method_one`.

In Java, both variables and method names:

-   Must begin with a letter, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`). They cannot start with a digit, so option A) `1stMethod` is not valid.
-   Can contain letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. However, they cannot contain hyphens or other special characters, so option C) `first-Method` is not valid.
-   Are case-sensitive. This means `myMethod`, `mymethod`, and `MYMETHOD` would be considered different method names.
-   Should not be Java reserved words. There are certain keywords like `int`, `void`, `class`, etc., which have a special meaning in Java and therefore cannot be used as method or variable names.

So, option B) `method_one` is a valid method name because it starts with a letter and contains only letters and an underscore. This makes `method_one` the correct answer.

# 6

The correct answer is A) `/methods`.

Here's why:

A) `/methods`: This command lists all the methods that are currently defined in the JShell session. Therefore, this is the correct answer.

B) `/list`: This command lists all the snippets of code you've entered in the current JShell session, not just the methods. So, while this command will show the methods along with other types of code snippets (like variable definitions, statements, etc.), it's not the best answer because it doesn't list just the methods.

C) `/edit`: This command opens an editor where you can write or modify your code. It doesn't list the methods that are currently defined in the JShell session.

So, option A) `/methods` is the correct answer because it's the command that specifically lists all the methods in the current JShell session.


# 7

The correct answer is B) Allows you to modify the method definition in a separate editor window.

Here's why:

A) Lists the code of the specified method: This statement is incorrect. The `/edit` command doesn't list the code of the specified method. For that, you'd typically use the `/list` command in JShell.

B) Allows you to modify the method definition in a separate editor window: This statement is correct. The `/edit` command in JShell opens a text editor window where you can write or modify your code, including method definitions.

C) Saves the session method definitions to a file: This statement is incorrect. The `/edit` command doesn't save the session method definitions to a file. For saving the session, you would use the `/save` command in JShell.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

# 8

The correct answer is A) `void methodName(ArgType argName) { method-body }`.

Here's why:

A) `void methodName(ArgType argName) { method-body }`: This is the correct syntax for defining a method with an argument in Java. It starts with the `void` keyword to specify that the method doesn't return any value. `methodName` is the name of the method, and `(ArgType argName)` are the argument type and name. The method body, which contains the statements to be executed, is enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

B) `methodName(ArgType argName) { method-body }`: This syntax is incorrect because it's missing the return type of the method. In Java, you must specify the return type before the method name, even if the return type is `void` (meaning the method doesn't return any value).

C) `methodName(ArgType argName) { method-body; }`: This syntax is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it's missing the return type of the method, which should be specified before the method name. Secondly, the semicolon after `method-body` is unnecessary. In Java, a semicolon is used to end a statement, but it's not used after the closing brace of a method, class, or control structure.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

# 9

The correct answer is A)

```
void printNumbers(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

Here's why:

A) This method is correct. It starts from 1 (`int i = 1`), and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n` (`i <= n`). So it includes `n` in the output, and all numbers are printed from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

B) This method is almost correct, but it doesn't print the number `n`. The condition `i < n` means the loop will stop when `i` is equal to `n`, so `n` is not included in the output.

C) This method starts from 0 (`int i = 0`), so it doesn't start from 1 as the question specifies. Also, similar to option B, it doesn't print the number `n` because of the condition `i < n`.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer. It correctly prints all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

# 10

The correct answer is C) The program will fail to compile due to incompatible types.

Here's why:

A) The program will compile and run without any errors: This statement is incorrect. If a method is defined to accept an integer argument, you can't call it with a string argument. This would be a type mismatch, and the Java compiler would not allow it.

B) The program will throw a runtime error: This statement is incorrect. This situation wouldn't result in a runtime error, but a compile-time error. Java is a statically typed language, which means type checking is done at compile time. If you try to pass a string argument to a method that expects an integer, the Java compiler will catch this error and fail to compile the program.

C) The program will fail to compile due to incompatible types: This statement is correct. If you try to call a method with an argument of a type that the method isn't defined to accept, the Java compiler will throw an error about incompatible types, and the program will fail to compile. So, option C is the correct answer.

# 11

The correct answer is A) The ability to have multiple methods with the same name in a class, but with different types of arguments.

Here's why:

A) The ability to have multiple methods with the same name in a class, but with different types of arguments: This statement is correct. This is known as method overloading in Java. Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameter lists (which can vary in number, types, or order of arguments). The compiler uses these differences to determine which version of the method to call.

B) The ability to have multiple methods with the same name and the same types of arguments in a class: This statement is incorrect. In Java, it's not possible to have multiple methods with the exact same name and parameter list within the same class. This would cause a compilation error because the compiler wouldn't be able to distinguish between the methods.

C) The ability to have a single method with an arbitrary number of arguments: This statement is incorrect. This describes varargs (variable arguments) in Java, not method overloading. A varargs parameter allows a method to accept zero or multiple arguments of the same type, but it's not related to method overloading.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

# 12

The correct answers are A) The two methods are overloaded methods, B) The two methods have the same name and different number of arguments, and C) The two methods have the same name and the same types of arguments.

Here's why:

A) The two methods are overloaded methods: This statement is correct. Method overloading in Java is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name, but with different parameters. These two methods have the same name (`printName`), but different parameters, so they are examples of overloaded methods.

B) The two methods have the same name and different number of arguments: This statement is correct. Both methods have the name `printName`, but the first method takes two arguments (a first name and a last name), while the second method takes three arguments (a first name, a middle name, and a last name).

C) The two methods have the same name and the same types of arguments: This statement is correct. Both methods have the same name (`printName`), and both accept only `String` arguments. The fact that they take a different number of arguments doesn't change the fact that the types of their arguments are the same.

Therefore, all options A, B, and C are correct.

# 13

The correct answer is A) The output will be 3 and 6.

Here's why:

The method `sum(int a, int b)` is called with arguments 1 and 2, so it will print the sum of these two numbers, which is 3.

The method `sum(int a, int b, int c)` is called with arguments 1, 2, and 3, so it will print the sum of these three numbers, which is 6.

Therefore, the output of this code will be:

Copy code

`3
6` 

B) The output will be 3 and 5: This is incorrect because the second method call will sum 1, 2, and 3, which equals 6, not 5.

C) The code will not compile due to method overloading: This is incorrect. Method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) is a valid feature of Java, so this code will compile and run correctly. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

# 14

The correct answer is C) A method can accept any number of arguments, and they can be of different types.

Here's why:

A) A method can only accept up to 2 arguments: This statement is incorrect. A method in Java can accept more than two arguments. The number of arguments is only limited by the maximum size of a method's parameter list, which is well beyond practical usage scenarios.

B) A method can accept any number of arguments, but they must be of the same type: This statement is partially correct but not fully. It's true in the context of varargs (variable arguments), where a method can accept any number of arguments, but they must be of the same type. However, in general, a method can accept arguments of different types.

C) A method can accept any number of arguments, and they can be of different types: This statement is correct. A method in Java can accept multiple arguments, and these arguments can be of different types. Each argument must have a type and a name. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

# 15

The correct answer is A) To reduce code duplication by allowing methods with the same name but different arguments.

Here's why:

A) To reduce code duplication by allowing methods with the same name but different arguments: This statement is correct. Method overloading is a way to create methods that perform similar tasks but with different parameters. This enables more readable and maintainable code and reduces the need for different method names for similar tasks.

B) To allow a method to return different types of values based on the input arguments: This statement is incorrect. The return type of a method in Java is not influenced by method overloading. The return type of a method is determined at the time of defining the method and does not change based on the arguments passed during the method call.

C) To create multiple methods with the same name and the same number of arguments, but with different implementation: This statement is incorrect. While method overloading does involve creating multiple methods with the same name, these methods must differ in their parameter lists (either in the number, type, or order of parameters). If two methods have the same name and the same parameter list, Java would not be able to distinguish between them, leading to a compile-time error.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

# 16

The correct answers are A) To end the execution of the method and B) To return the result of a computation to the calling code.

Here's why:

A) To end the execution of the method: This statement is correct. When a return statement is executed, the method execution is stopped, and control is returned back to the caller.

B) To return the result of a computation to the calling code: This statement is correct. The primary purpose of the return statement is to return the result of a computation or an operation to the caller. The returned value can then be used in the calling code.

C) To print the output of the method: This statement is incorrect. The return statement does not print anything. Printing is usually done using System.out.println() or similar methods in Java. The return statement is used to return values back to the caller, not to output them.

Therefore, options A and B are the correct answers.

# 17

The correct answer is B) It enables sharing computed results with other code and methods, and improves breaking down a problem into sub-problems.

Here's why:

A) It allows the method to print the result of the computation: This statement is incorrect. The return mechanism in a method does not provide any printing capabilities. To print something, you would typically use System.out.println() or similar methods in Java. The return statement is used to return values from a method back to the calling code.

B) It enables sharing computed results with other code and methods, and improves breaking down a problem into sub-problems: This statement is correct. Using return statements in methods allows for the results of computations to be used elsewhere in the program, such as in other methods or as part of further computations. This helps in breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems by allowing different parts of the code to handle different sub-tasks and share their results.

C) It simplifies the syntax of the method: This statement is incorrect. The return statement doesn't necessarily simplify the syntax of a method. It's a tool to pass results back to the caller, not to simplify the syntax.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
