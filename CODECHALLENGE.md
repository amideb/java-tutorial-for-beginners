### Step 12: More Formatted Output


####  Exercise 1: 
Create a Java program using JShell to print the following multiplication table on the console:

1 * 1 = 1 1 * 2 = 2 1 * 3 = 3 ... 1 * 10 = 10

##### Solution 1:

```
// Using JShell to print multiplication table for 1
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.printf("1 * %d = %d%n", i, 1 * i);
}
```
Output:

```
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
1 * 4 = 4
1 * 5 = 5
1 * 6 = 6
1 * 7 = 7
1 * 8 = 8
1 * 9 = 9
1 * 10 = 10
```

Explanation: The for loop iterates from 1 to 10, and for each iteration, it uses the printf method to print the multiplication table for 1. The `%d` format specifier is used to print the value of the loop variable `i`, and `%n` is used to print a newline character.

#### Exercise 2: 
Create a Java program using JShell to print the following output on the console:

3.5 + 2.8 + 1.9 = 8.2

##### Solution 2:

```
// Using JShell to print the sum of three decimal numbers
double a = 3.5;
double b = 2.8;
double c = 1.9;
double sum = a + b + c;
System.out.printf("%.1f + %.1f + %.1f = %.1f%n", a, b, c, sum);
```

Output:

```
3.5 + 2.8 + 1.9 = 8.2
```

Explanation: The program declares three double variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and initializes them with the values 3.5, 2.8, and 1.9 respectively. It then calculates the sum of these variables and stores it in the `sum` variable. Finally, it uses the printf method to print the output with one decimal point using the `%f` format specifier and the `%.1f` modifier. `%n` is used to print a newline character.

```
jshell> i = 3
i ==> 3
jshell> System.out.printf("%d * %d = %d\n", 5, i, 5*i)
5 * 3 = 15

jshell> i = 4
i ==> 4
jshell> System.out.printf("%d * %d = %d\n", 5, i, 5*i)
5 * 4 = 20

jshell> i = 5
i ==> 5
jshell> System.out.printf("%d * %d = %d\n", 5, i, 5*i)
5 * 5 = 25

int b = 25;
int sum = a + b;
System.out.println("The sum of a and b is: " + sum);

float c = 3.5f;
float d = 2.0f;
float product = c * d;
System.out.println("The product of c and d is: " + product);

double e = 30.0;
int f = 4;
double division = e / f;
System.out.println("The result of dividing e by f is: " + division);

float f1 = 3.14f;
float f2 = 3.14f;
boolean floatsEqual = (f1 == f2);
System.out.println("Are f1 and f2 equal? " + floatsEqual);

double d1 = 25.678;
double d2 = 25.678;
boolean doublesEqual = (d1 == d2);
System.out.println("Are d1 and d2 equal? " + doublesEqual);

char c1 = 'A';
char c2 = 'A';

// Calculate the sum of temperatures
double sumTemperatures = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < dailyTemperatures.length; i++) {
    sumTemperatures += dailyTemperatures[i];
}

// Calculate the average temperature
double averageTemperature = sumTemperatures / dailyTemperatures.length;

// Display the average temperature
System.out.println("The average temperature for the week is: " + averageTemperature);
```

#### Exercise 2: Determining leap years

Write a program in JShell to determine if a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is exactly divisible by 4, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100. However, years that are exactly divisible by 400 are also considered leap years.

**Solution:**

```
// Define a year to check if it's a leap year
int year = 2024;

// Determine if the year is a leap year
boolean isLeapYear = (year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);

// Display the result
if (isLeapYear) {
    System.out.println(year + " is a leap year.");
} else {
    System.out.println(year + " is not a leap year.");
}
```




### Step 20: The Assignment Operator =




#### Exercise 1: Increment and Decrement Counter

**Problem**

Write a Java program using JShell to demonstrate the use of increment and decrement operations on a counter variable `counter`. Follow these steps:

1.  Initialize `counter` with 0.
2.  Increment `counter` by 5.
3.  Decrement `counter` by 2.

**Solution**

```
jshell> int counter = 0;
counter ==> 0

jshell> counter = counter + 5;
counter ==> 5

jshell> counter = counter - 2;
counter ==> 3

jshell> counter;
counter ==> 3
```

#### Exercise 2: Calculate the power of a number using increments

**Problem**

Write a Java program using JShell to calculate the power of a number `base` raised to an exponent `exponent`. Do this using increments and a loop.

**Solution**

```
jshell> int base = 2;
base ==> 2

jshell> int exponent = 3;
exponent ==> 3

jshell> int result = 1;
result ==> 1

jshell> for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
   ...>   result = result * base;
   ...> }
jshell> result;
result ==> 8
```



### Step 21: Assignment Puzzles, and PMT-Challenge revisited



#### Exercise 1: Pre- and Post- Increment and Decrement with JShell

**Problem:**

Using JShell, create a variable called `count` and initialize it with the value `10`. Then, apply pre- and post-increment and pre- and post-decrement operators. Print the value of the `count` variable after each operation to observe the differences.

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int count = 10
count ==> 10

jshell> ++count
$1 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 11

jshell> count++
$2 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 12

jshell> --count
$3 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 11

jshell> count--
$4 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 10
```

#### Exercise 2: Compound Assignment Operators with JShell

**Problem:**

Using JShell, create a variable called `value` and initialize it with the value `8`. Apply various compound assignment operators on `value` and print its value after each operation.

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int value = 8
value ==> 8

jshell> value += 4
$1 ==> 12

jshell> value
value ==> 12

jshell> value -= 2
$2 ==> 10

jshell> value
value ==> 10

jshell> value *= 3
$3 ==> 30

jshell> value
value ==> 30

jshell> value /= 2
$4 ==> 15

value ==> 3
```




### Step 22: Some  `JShell`  Usage Tips

#### Exercise 1

#### Problem

Write a short program in JShell to calculate the area of a rectangle using the given length and width. Use JShell internal variables to store the results of your calculations. Finally, print the area of the rectangle.

##### Solution

1.  Open JShell by typing `jshell` in your command prompt or terminal.
2.  Enter the following commands one by one in JShell:

```
int length = 10
int width = 5
int area = length * width
System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + area)
```

3.  You should see the output: `Area of the rectangle: 50`

#### Exercise 2

#### Problem

Create a simple program in JShell to add two numbers and print their sum. Then, use JShell shortcuts to modify the previous input and calculate the sum of two different numbers.

##### Solution

1.  Open JShell by typing `jshell` in your command prompt or terminal.
2.  Enter the following commands one by one in JShell:

```
int num1 = 3
int num2 = 7
int sum = num1 + num2
System.out.println("Sum of the numbers: " + sum)
```

3.  You should see the output: `Sum of the numbers: 10`
4.  Now, use the up-arrow key to navigate back to the `int num1 = 3` line and modify the value of `num1`:

```
int num1 = 5
```

5.  Use the up-arrow key again to navigate back to the `int num2 = 7` line and modify the value of `num2`:

```
int num2 = 9
```

6.  Finally, use the up-arrow key to navigate back to the `int sum = num1 + num2` and `System.out.println("Sum of the numbers: " + sum)` lines to re-execute them.
7.  You should now see the output: `Sum of the numbers: 14`




### Step 23: Introducing Conditionals - the if

   ...> }
   ```

#### Exercise 2

**Problem Statement:**

Create a JShell script that assigns a value to an integer `y` and checks if `y` is greater than 15. If `y` is greater than 15, print "y is greater than 15" and "y is a large number". If `y` is not greater than 15, print "y is not greater than 15".

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int y = 20;
jshell> if (y > 15) {
   ...> System.out.println("y is greater than 15");
   ...> System.out.println("y is a large number");
