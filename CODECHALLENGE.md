## Java Multiple Choice Quiz & Code Challenge

### Step 01: First Challenge : The Print-Multiplication-Table (PMT-Challenge)


#### Exercise 1: PMT Challenge Using For Loop

Using JShell, write a program to display the multiplication table for 7, with entries from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

###### Solution

Launch JShell and enter the following commands:


```
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("7 * " + i + " = " + (7*i));
}
``` 

Output:


```
7 * 1 = 7
7 * 2 = 14
7 * 3 = 21
7 * 4 = 28
7 * 5 = 35
7 * 6 = 42
7 * 7 = 49
7 * 8 = 56
7 * 9 = 63
7 * 10 = 70
``` 

#### Exercise 2: PMT Challenge Using While Loop

Using JShell, write a program to display the multiplication table for 3, with entries from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

###### Solution

Launch JShell and enter the following commands:


```
int i = 1;
while(i <= 5) {
    System.out.println("3 * " + i + " = " + (3*i));
    i++;
}
```

Output:


```
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
3 * 4 = 12
3 * 5 = 15
```
